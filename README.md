# FoodAid
Within the realm of the Zero Hunger category at a hackathon, we introduced the Food-Aid project. 
This ambitious endeavor boasts a comprehensive webpage, dedicated to shedding light on the pressing issue of food waste. 
At its core, we developed an innovative donation platform that allows users to post surplus food items from their own fridges. 
With detailed descriptions and accompanying photos, this platform serves as a bridge between those with excess food and those in need.
Furthermore, we've implemented a user-friendly interface for discovering nearby households willing to donate food, facilitating seamless connections between donors and recipients. 
To enhance our understanding of food wastage, we conducted thorough exploratory data analysis using a dataset specifically focused on this issue. 
The insightful results were presented visually through a range of informative graphs.
